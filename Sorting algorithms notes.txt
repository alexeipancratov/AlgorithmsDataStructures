A stable sort preserves the relative order of items with equal keys.

Stable sorting algs:
	- insertion sort,
	- merge sort

Unstable sorting algs:
	- selection sort,
	- shellsort
	
It depends on equal vs. equal or less(greater than).
If items with the same keys move past each other then it's unstable. Otherwise is stable.
